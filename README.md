# LShell - A Linux Command Line Interface Clone
## Introduction
### What is it?
LShell is a scalable command line interface clone to interact with the Linux OS. LShell is developed using C++. It also employes efficient software development principles such as object oriented programming, design patterns, and implementation of algorithms.

### Purpose
This is originally a project done at UC Riverside's CS100 class (introduction to software engineering) during the winter quarter of 2020. Due to the outbreak of COVID19, my partner and I were unable to finish the project. LShell is a refactorization and extention of the original in class project. 

## Concepts Used
    - Design Patterns
        - Composite Pattern
